## Commications

The team had a pretty rough start going into the project. We didn't know each other, our schedules, skills or experience levels. It turned out to be quite a roadblock throughout the entire course. We experienced a lot of miscommunication and times with no communication at all, which would result in tasks being completed twice, tasks not being met at all and group members working alone on a big task.

Because of the lack of communication, we created quite a backlog throughout the course. We did, at one point, create a technical debt on the API, which meant that a group member had to work on the CICD alone.

We should have started by getting to know each other and match our expectations for the project. We had a lot of different backgrounds; three were writing their bachelor, and four had a job taking up time. It meant that we should have focused a lot more time discussing schedules and meetings, not meeting odd hours every week. By focusing more time on this, we could have gone into the project with a better foundation and possibly a better end product.


## Tool choice

With the lack of communication came some bad choices. We chose to go with a framework that only one group member knew, which meant that the rest of the group had to use a lot of time getting to know the structure and functionalities.

Django is an extensive scale framework. It has a large amount of implemented functionality; easy database management, easy implementation of views and pages, authentications tools and security features. It is beneficial when you use it as a large scale API framework. We ran into a problem here because our project didn't take advantage of these features the way it was meant to be used. Django turned out to be unmanageable for inexperienced users due to the high complexity of the innate features.


... using tools we already know (% django) % python latest, use db instead of global variable in python.

## Technical debt

testing implementations (vagrant; mac)
we werent ready for the simulator (already behind)
when you have a enormous backlog dont choose the harder implementation (docker swarm)
get loggin up and running for use.
