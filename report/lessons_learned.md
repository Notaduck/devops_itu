## Commications

The team had a pretty rough start going into the project. We didn't know eachother, our schedules, skills or experience levels. This turned out to be quite a roadblock through the entire course. We experienced a lot of miss-communication and times with no communication at all, which would result in tasks being completed twice, task not being completed at all and group members working alone on a big task.

Because of the lack of communication, we created quite the backlog througout the course. We did at one point, create a technical debt on the API, which meant that a group member had to work on the CICD alone.

We should have started out by getting to know eatchother and match our expectations for the project. We had a lot of different backgrounds; three were writing their bachelor and four had a job taking up time aswell, this meant that we should have focused a lot more time into discussing schedules and meetings, so that we didn't end up meeting at odd hours every week. By focusing more time on this, we could have gone into the project with a better foundation and maybe a better endproduct. 


## Tool choice

With the lack of communication came some bad choices. We chose to go with a framework that only one group member knew, which meant that the rest of the group had to use a lot of time getting to know the structure and functionalities. 

Django is a large scale framework. It has a large amount of implemented functionality; easy database management, easy implementation of views and pages, authentications tools and security features. This is all very usefull when you use it as a large scale API framework, the problem we ran into here was that our project didn't take advantage of these features the way it was meant to. Django turned out to be unmanageable for inexperienced users due to the high complexity of the innate features.

We should have started out discussing several choices including prices on the long run, for the whole tech stack as well as the teammembers prior work with these.

## Technical debt

The team didn't use enough time going through and testing the individual pull request, which meant that we spent a lot of time looking into small errors that ...

When the simulator started, we already had a backlog resulting in our product not being ready for the simulator. This meant that some register request already failed the first day, resulting in future error on message and follow request. The team should have focused a lot more time into getting the project ready for the simulator together and thus avoiding future errors. 

Later in the project, we decided to try and implement docker swarm. This took a lot of time and looking back, we probably should'nt have chosen the harder implementation when we already had quite a big backlog. We did learn a lot from working with docker swarm and in the end it was really worth it to get it up and running for the learning experience.

Our technical debt included a couple of errors from former tasks. It took a lot of time to find these and fix them. We should have focused more time into getting the loggin system up and running for use, so that we actually had a tool to help us in these cases.
