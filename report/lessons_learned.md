CICD

Logging in Django can be implemeted as middleware allowing logging of both existing views and future views withour tailoring the logging system in each and every view. This both results in a very simplistic an all sided logging system, without hindering the developer in adding new features or functionality.

## Commications

Importance of communicating in a devops team (different skills / experience)
    Get to know each other
    Match your expectations

Organizing

technical debt on api, (Daniel alone on CICD)

## Tool choice

Large scale framework 
 - much implemeted functionality
    - easy database management
    - easy implementation of simplistic views and pages
    - large scale api framework
    - authentication tools
    - security features by default
 - simplistic custom implementation
 - many resources for help (large docs, stack overflow, widely used)

disadvantages:
 - much implemeted functionality
    - unmanageable for inexperienced users due to the high complexity of the innate features


... use tools we already know (% django) % python 
latest, use db instead of global variable in python.

## Technical debt

testing implementations (vagrant; mac)
we werent ready for the simulator (already behind)
when you have a enormous backlog dont choose the harder implementation (docker swarm)
get loggin up and running for use.
